# Activity Gas Delivery
---
Deliver gas to different gas stations throughout the city, beware though you need to maintain and check the amount of fuel you have in your tank before trying
to go to a station and fueling or you will not be able too. Will be adding more "refuel" trailer zones soon only one at the moment.

# How payout is calculated
---
By default payout is set to "$11" per 1% a gas station needs so if the gas station needs 60% fuel to be fully fueled 
and the person does that they would recieve $660 for that one run.

# Todo

* Add more gas stations
